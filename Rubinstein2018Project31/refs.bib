abstract = "We have recently completed a full rearchitecturing of the Rosetta molecular modeling program, generalizing and expanding its existing functionality. The new architecture enables the rapid prototyping of novel protocols by providing easy-to-use interfaces to powerful tools for molecular modeling. The source code of this rearchitecturing has been released as Rosetta3 and is freely available for academic use. At the time of its release, it contained 470,000 lines of code. Counting currently unpublished protocols at the time of this writing, the source includes 1,285,000 lines. Its rapid growth is a testament to its ease of use. This chapter describes the requirements for our new architecture, justifies the design decisions, sketches out central classes, and highlights a few of the common tasks that the new software can perform.",

		 primary structure of a protein that folds into a given
		 geometrical shape. This method predicts the primary
		 structure of a protein and restores its linear sequence
		 of amino acids in the polypeptide chain using the
		 tertiary structure of a molecule. Unknown amino acids
		 are determined according to the principle of energy
		 minimization. This study represents inverse folding
		 problem as a quadratic optimization problem and uses
		 different relaxation techniques to reduce it to the
		 problem of convex optimizations. Computational
		 experiment compares the quality of these approaches on
